	abstract = {The ability of quantile regression models to characterize the heterogeneous impact of variables on different points of an outcome distribution makes them appealing in many economic applications. However, in observational studies, the variables of interest (e.g., education, prices) are often endogenous, making conventional quantile regression inconsistent and hence inappropriate for recovering the causal effects of these variables on the quantiles of economic outcomes. In order to address this problem, we develop a model of quantile treatment effects ({QTE)} in the presence of endogeneity and obtain conditions for identification of the {QTE} without functional form assumptions. The principal feature of the model is the imposition of conditions that restrict the evolution of ranks across treatment states. This feature allows us to overcome the endogeneity problem and recover the true {QTE} through the use of instrumental variables. The proposed model can also be equivalently viewed as a structural simultaneous equation model with nonadditive errors, where {QTE} can be interpreted as the structural quantile effects ({SQE).}},

The semiparametric assumptions exploit variation in observable covariates to narrow the bounds. In our main model, the outcome is determined by a generalized linear model, but the treatment may be arbitrarily endogenous. Our bounding strategy does not require the existence of an instrument, but incorporating an instrument narrows the bounds. The bounds are further improved by combining the semiparametric model with the joint threshold-crossing assumption of Shaikh and Vytlacil (2005)},

	abstract = {We are interested in estimating the average effect of a binary treatment on a scalar outcome. If assignment to the treatment is exogenous or unconfounded, that is, independent of the potential outcomes given covariates, biases associated with simple treatment-control average comparisons can be removed by adjusting for differences in the covariates. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that adjusting solely for differences between treated and control units in the propensity score removes all biases associated with differences in covariates. Although adjusting for differences in the propensity score removes all the bias, this can come at the expense of efficiency, as shown by Hahn (1998), Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), and Robins, Mark, and Newey (1992). We show that weighting by the inverse of a nonparametric estimate of the propensity score, rather than the true propensity score, leads to an efficient estimate of the average treatment effect. We provide intuition for this result by showing that this estimator can be interpreted as an empirical likelihood estimator that efficiently incorporates the information about the propensity score.},

	abstract = {Many randomized experiments suffer from noncompliance. Some
of these experiments, so-called encouragement designs, can be
expected to have especially large amounts of noncompliance, because
encouragement to take the treatment rather than the treatment itself
is randomly assigned to individuals. We present an extended framework
for the analysis of data from such experiments with a binary
treatment, binary encouragement, and background covariates. There are
two key features of this framework: we use an instrumental variables
approach to link intention-to-treat effects to treatment effects and
we adopt a Bayesian approach for inference and sensitivity analysis.
This framework is illustrated in a medical example concerning the
effects of inoculation for influenza. In this example, the analyses
suggest that positive estimates of the intention-to-treat effect need
not be due to the treatment itself, but rather to the encouragement
to take the treatment: the intention-to-treat effect for the
subpopulation who would be inoculated whether or not encouraged is
estimated to be approximately as large as the intention-to-treat
effect for the subpopulation whose inoculation status would agree
with their (randomized) encouragement status whether or not
encouraged. Thus, our methods suggest that global intention-to-treat
estimates, although often regarded as conservative, can be too coarse
and even misleading when taken as summarizing the evidence in the
data for the effects of treatments.},

	abstract = {Recently, instrumental variables methods have been used to address non‐compliance in randomized experiments. Complicating such analyses is often the presence of missing data. The standard model for missing data, missing at random ({MAR)}, has some unattractive features in this context. In this paper we compare {MAR‐based} estimates of the complier average causal effect ({CACE)} with an estimator based on an alternative, nonignorable model for the missing data process, developed by Frangakis and Rubin (1999, Biometrika, 86, 365–379). We also introduce a new missing data model that, like the {Frangakis–Rubin} model, is specially suited for models with instrumental variables, but makes different substantive assumptions. We analyze these issues in the context of a randomized trial of breast self‐examination ({BSE).} In the study two methods of teaching {BSE}, consisting of either mailed information about {BSE} (the standard treatment) or the attendance of a course involving theoretical and practical sessions (the new treatment), were compared with the aim of assessing whether teaching programs could increase {BSE} practice and improve examination skills. The study was affected by the two sources of bias mentioned above: only 55\% of women assigned to receive the new treatment complied with their assignment and 35\% of the women did not respond to the post‐test questionnaire. Comparing the causal estimand of the new treatment using the {MAR}, {Frangakis–Rubin}, and our new approach, the results suggest that for these data the {MAR} assumption appears least plausible, and that the new model appears most plausible among the three choices.},

The rationale for focusing on nonlinear models is that, if the dependent variable is binary or limited, or if the effect of the treatment varies with covariates, a nonlinear model is appropriate. In the spirit of Roehrig (Econometrica 56 (1988) 433), identification is attained nonparametrically and does not depend on the choice of the parametric specification for the response function of interest. One virtue of this approach is that it allows the researcher to construct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-defined approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspecification. In contrast to some usual {IV} models, heterogeneity of treatment effects is not restricted by the identification conditions. The ideas and estimators in this article are illustrated using {IV} to estimate the effects of 401(k) retirement programs on savings.},

The average causal effect in which we are interested is a conditional expectation of the difference between the outcomes of the treated and what these outcomes would have been in the absence of treatment. Given mild regularity assumptions, the probability limit of {TSLS} is a weighted average of per-unit average causal effects along the length of an appropriately defined causal response function. The weighting function is illustrated in an empirical example based on the relationship between schooling and earnings.},

For each law, we use {OLS} to compute the {DD} estimate of its “effect” as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional {DD} standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an “effect” significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a “pre”and “post”-period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.},

Yet many interesting questions regarding the political economy of programmes, the distribution of programme benefits and the option values conferred on programme participants require knowledge of the distribution of impacts, or features of it. This paper presents evidence that heterogeneity in response to programmes is empirically important and that classical probability inequalities are not very informative in producing estimates or bounds on the distribution of programme impacts. We explore two methods for supplementing the information in these inequalities based on assumptions about participant decision-making processes and about the strength in dependence between outcomes in the participation and non-participation states. Dependence is produced as a consequence of rational choice by participants. We test for stochastic rationality among programme participants and present and implement methods for estimating the option values of social programmes.},

It is shown that the treatment effect can be estimated at the rate for one-dimensional nonparametric regression irrespective of the dimension of X. It thus extends the analysis of Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaauw (2001) and Porter (2003), who examined identification and estimation without covariates, requiring assumptions that may often be too strong in applications. In many applications, individuals to the left and right of the threshold differ in observed characteristics. Houses may be constructed in different ways across school attendance district boundaries. Firms may differ around a threshold that implies certain legal changes, etc. Accounting for these differences in covariates is important to reduce bias. In addition, accounting for covariates may also reduces variance. Finally, estimation of quantile treatment effects ({QTE)} is also considered.},

Such a scenario is common in observational studies and in randomized experiments with imperfect compliance. One possible approach to this problem is to compare the counterfactual cumulative distribution functions of the outcome with and without the treatment. This article shows how to estimate these distributions using instrumental variable methods and a simple bootstrap procedure is proposed to test distributional hypotheses, such as equality of distributions, first-order and second-order stochastic dominance. These tests and estimators are applied to the study of the effects of veteran status on the distribution of civilian earnings. The results show a negative effect of military service during the Vietnam era that appears to be concentrated on the lower tail of the distribution of earnings. First-order stochastic dominance cannot be rejected by the data.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses estimation of nonparametric models whose regressor vectors consist of a vector of exogenous variables and a univariate discrete endogenous regressor with finite support. Both identification and estimators are derived from a transform of the model that evaluates the nonparametric structural function via indicator functions in the support of the discrete regressor. A two-step estimator is proposed where the first step constitutes nonparametric estimation of the instrument and the second step is a nonparametric version of two-stage least squares. Linear functionals of the model are shown to be asymptotically normal, and a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix is described. For the binary endogenous regressor case, it is shown that one functional of the model is a conditional (on covariates) local average treatment effect, that permits both unobservable and observable heterogeneity in treatments. Finite sample properties of the estimators from a Monte Carlo simulation study illustrate the practicability of the proposed estimators.},

	abstract = {This chapter relates the literature on the econometric evaluation of social programs to the literature in statistics on "causal inference". In it, we develop a general evaluation framework that addresses well-posed economic questions and analyzes agent choice rules and subjective evaluations of outcomes as well as the standard objective evaluations of outcomes. The framework recognizes uncertainty faced by agents and ex ante and ex post evaluations of programs. It also considers distributions of treatment effects. These features are absent from the statistical literature on causal inference. A prototypical model of agent choice and outcomes is used to illustrate the main ideas.
We formally develop models for counterfactuals and causality that build on Cowles Commission econometrics. These models anticipate and extend the literature on causal inference in statistics. The distinction between fixing and conditioning that has recently entered the statistical literature was first developed by Cowles economists. Models of simultaneous causality were also developed by the Cowles group, as were notions of invariance to policy interventions. These basic notions are updated to nonlinear and nonparametric frameworks for policy evaluation more general than anything in the current statistical literature on "causal inference". A formal discussion of identification is presented and applied to clearly formulated choice models used to evaluate social programs.},

The value of well posed economic choice models for decision making under uncertainty in analyzing and interpreting dynamic intervention studies is developed. A survey of the dynamic discrete-choice literature is presented. (3) The key ideas and papers in the recent literature on general equilibrium evaluations of social programs are summarized.},

	abstract = {This chapter uses the marginal treatment effect ({MTE)} to unify and organize the econometric literature on the evaluation of social programs. The marginal treatment effect is a choice-theoretic parameter that can be interpreted as a willingness to pay parameter for persons at a margin of indifference between participating in an activity or not. All of the conventional treatment parameters as well as the more economically motivated treatment effects can be generated from a baseline marginal treatment effect. All of the estimation methods used in the applied evaluation literature, such as matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity methods, selection and control function methods, make assumptions about the marginal treatment effect which we exposit. Models for multiple outcomes are developed. Empirical examples of the leading methods are presented. Methods are presented for bounding treatment effects in partially identified models, when the marginal treatment effect is known only over a limited support. We show how to use the marginal treatment in econometric cost benefit analysis, in defining limits of policy experiments, in constructing the average marginal treatment effect, and in forecasting the effects of programs in new environments.},
